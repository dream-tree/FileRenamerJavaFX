# FileRenamerJavaFX

Simple file renamer application allowing user to rename set of files with desired name e.g., Summer2018. User can choose numbering position - left or right, what means numbering either starts first or is added to the end of user input text. Files are renamed in a sequence chosen in the filechoser window - files can be sorted by name or in reverse order, by modification time, by date of creation and so on, as desired (with system restrictions).

FileRenamerJavaFX project is made with JavaFX technology and uses "plain" Java code for GUI building (for exercising purposes). JavaFX Scene Builder haven't been used.

It also uses some basic Spring Framework features (Spring Core) i.e, dependency injection (with annotation-based configuration).

Project #004.
