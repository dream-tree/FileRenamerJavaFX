# FileRenamerJavaFX

Simple file renamer application allowing user to rename set of files with desired name e.g., Summer2018. User can choose numbering position - left or right, what means numbering either starts first or is added to the end of user input text. Files are renamed in a sequence chosen in the filechoser window - files can be sorted by name or in reverse order, by modification time, by date of creation and so on, as desired (with system restrictions).

FileRenamerJavaFX project is made with JavaFX technology and uses "plain" Java code for GUI building (for exercising purposes). JavaFX Scene Builder haven't been used.

It also uses some basic Spring Framework features (Spring Core) i.e, dependency injection (with annotation-based configuration).

Project #004.

This project and the solutions it introduces, like every single one in my repositories, was not based on any ready-made internet or book project sample, any tutorial or anyone else idea other than me. All solutions are made by me, to practice coding and solving problems. Google was a friend of mine (of course) but all the implemented features in my projects are developed or implemented solely by me. That means I did not used any ready project templates from any external sources.
